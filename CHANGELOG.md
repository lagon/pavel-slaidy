# Changelog

Dates are when the work landed, not when it was released; there are no releases yet.

## Unreleased

### Added
- **PDF in portrait.** Export has a *PDF · portrait* button: every slide at the top of its
  own A4 sheet, full width, the rest of the page left blank for writing on. Hidden slides
  print, as they do in the landscape PDF.
- **PDF in portrait, with notes.** *PDF · portrait with notes* puts each slide at the top of
  its A4 sheet and that slide's speaker notes below it, in the room the landscape notes
  strip never had. A slide without notes gets the slide alone.
- **A talk is a link, and the link has three faces.** `scripts/publish.py` puts a deck
  under `site/`, where the Pages workflow makes it a page carrying the whole editor;
  `#present` on the end opens straight into the projector. Beside the deck it writes
  `notes/`, the speaker notes as a document that prints. `scripts/commentary.py` writes
  `commentary/`: every slide as it projects, with a paragraph under it for the audience
  that says what the slide claims and links the sources in the text.
  The ISD 2026 keynote is published this way and kept in `decks/isd2026.json` as the
  worked example of a deck that has been used in anger.
- **A figure of your own.** The figure picker has four ways in: from the library, generate,
  draw by hand on a blank canvas, or paste SVG. A generated figure is measured before it is
  accepted — thin lines, labels inside their boxes, nothing piled up — and drawn once more
  with the complaints if it fails.
- **Work that waits.** An edit, a rewrite or a list of ideas asked of one slide carries on
  when you move to another slide, and is there when you come back.
- **Slides move between decks.** Select in the list — click, `Shift`-click, `Ctrl`-click,
  `Ctrl-A` — then `Ctrl-C` / `Ctrl-X` / `Ctrl-V`, or right-click for the same menu. The
  markdown goes to the system clipboard with the figures in a trailer behind it, so a paste
  into another deck — another browser, or the application window, which reads the clipboard
  itself — arrives whole. An incoming figure whose id already means something else here
  does not overwrite it.
- **`###` is a big heading inside a slide**, `####` a smaller one, and a numbered list has
  room for its numbers.
- **`scripts/check_links.py`** resolves every DOI and arXiv id in a deck and says which are
  dead — and only says dead when the publisher does, not when it merely refuses a script.
- **A deck from a brief.** Abstract, the questions it must answer, the arc, how long you
  have — it comes back with the shape: sections, and per slide a title and the one line
  it is there to do. What is seeded is each slide's *purpose*, so every slide is one
  press from being written.
- **Formulas.** `$x^2$` and `$$…$$`, TeX in and MathML out, no library. What it cannot
  parse comes back as the TeX you typed rather than as something quietly wrong.
- **Headings inside a slide** (`####`), fenced code blocks, strikethrough.
- **`⋯ → AI usage`** — calls, tokens as the endpoint reported them, time waited, and
  what the spending went on. Counted in the browser, never sent anywhere.
- **Per-slide style overrides.** A slide keeps only what it disagrees with; everything
  else follows the deck.
- **Text size per slide**, and a canvas that can be trimmed or cropped to its drawing.
- **A source editor shared by slides and figures**, with the preview linked to the
  source both ways.
- **`New deck…`** asks where it will be saved before you start.

### Changed
- **The application opens the deck you had**, and never the example on its own: a deck
  that has moved is dropped from the recent list, and a second copy started while one is
  running takes the next port, so two decks can sit side by side.
- **A window, not a tab.** `install.sh` puts SlAIdy in the launcher with an icon, and
  `studio.sh` opens it in a GTK/WebKit window of its own where those are present. The
  installer checks that the file it installed is the one you are looking at, and the ⋯
  menu carries the stamp of the copy being served.
- **The project is called SlAIdy.** The name in the toolbar is the link to the source.
- The AI can be pointed at **CESNET e-INFRA CZ** in one click, and `studio.sh` prefers it
  when `CESNET_API_KEY` is in the environment or in `.env`. A reasoning model's token
  budget is scaled so it has room to answer after it has finished thinking, the e-INFRA
  four-at-a-time cap is respected, and an empty completion is reported as what it is.
- **The deck file is the document.** Started with `studio.sh`, the server owns it and
  every save writes to it. No permission prompt, no second copy.
- Generated figures are told how sparse to be, in numbers measured from the deck they
  are drawing for: twelve labels of one to four words.
- Your instruction outranks the house style; it did not, and asking for something
  catchy quietly got you the house default back.

### Fixed
- The editor now fits the device. The slide was capped at 940px however large the screen, and
  below 1000px the three columns simply overflowed — on a phone the toolbar pushed **Present**
  off the edge.

- Centring a row collapsed its figure to nothing: the column stopped stretching, and the
  figure sizes itself from that column's height. Found by looking at the demo deck.

- **Edits could be lost three ways at once**: the deck was copied to be served, so every
  restart looked newer than your work; a file handle could not be re-permissioned after
  a restart; and rebuilding from markdown wrote over a newer deck. All three closed, and
  a save that fails now says so loudly rather than in a corner.
- **The per-paragraph controls were invisible** — positioned in a gutter outside the
  text column, which clips. They are in the block's own corner now, and a paragraph can
  be dragged.
- An inline figure was contained on width only, so a figure among text could be taller
  than the slide and push everything under it off the bottom.
- A hidden slide vanished from the list, because its state class collided with a global
  `display:none` utility.

### Security
- A deck is treated as untrusted text, because one can now arrive from anywhere. Link
  schemes are checked (`javascript:` keeps its words and loses its target), figure SVGs
  are stripped of `<script>`, `on*` handlers and `foreignObject` on every render path,
  and the figure editor's canvas is sandboxed. `scripts/serve.py` caps the size of a
  written deck and refuses cross-origin calls to its AI proxy.
- Copying slides used to report success even when both the clipboard and the browser
  store had refused it.

### Removed
- **Trim to length.** Which slides matter is the one judgement a tool cannot make for
  you, and the deck-wide guess was worse than no answer. `scripts/short_run.py` still
  does it offline.
- The tag markers that used to trail slide titles. Nobody in the room knew what they meant.
